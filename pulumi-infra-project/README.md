# Pulumi Infrastructure Project

This repository contains a comprehensive infrastructure as code (IaC) setup using Pulumi for managing resources across AWS, Azure, and GCP. The project is structured to facilitate the deployment and management of cloud resources in a scalable and maintainable manner.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Node.js, Pulumi, and the necessary cloud provider CLI tools installed.
2. **Installation**: Clone the repository and install dependencies using npm:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. **Configuration**: Set up your cloud provider credentials and configure the necessary environment variables.
4. **Deployment**: Use Pulumi to deploy the infrastructure:
   ```
   pulumi up
   ```

## Pulumi vs. Terraform/Terragrunt

Pulumi, Terraform, and Terragrunt are all popular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools, but they differ in several key ways:

**Pulumi**
- Uses general-purpose programming languages (TypeScript, Python, Go, C#, etc.) for defining infrastructure.
- Supports strong typing, code reuse, and integration with existing software development workflows.
- State management can be local or remote (Pulumi Service, S3, Azure Blob, etc.).
- Rich support for cloud providers and resources, with direct SDK access.

**Terraform**
- Uses its own declarative language (HCL) for infrastructure definitions.
- State management is handled via local files or remote backends (S3, Azure Blob, etc.).
- Large ecosystem of providers and modules.
- Focuses on declarative infrastructure and modularity.

**Terragrunt**
- Wrapper for Terraform that adds features for managing multiple environments, DRY configurations, and automation.
- Uses HCL for configuration, but adds hierarchical configuration and tooling for complex deployments.

**Key Differences**
- Pulumi allows you to use familiar programming languages and leverage software engineering best practices.
- Terraform is purely declarative and may be easier for teams preferring configuration over code.
- Terragrunt is best for managing large, multi-environment Terraform deployments.

**When to Use Each**
- Use Pulumi if you want to integrate infrastructure with application code, need advanced logic, or prefer a programming language.
- Use Terraform for straightforward, declarative infrastructure management and a large module ecosystem.
- Use Terragrunt if you need to manage many Terraform environments and want DRY, maintainable configurations.
