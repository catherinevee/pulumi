# Pulumi Security Implementation Guide

This guide summarizes the security controls and best practices implemented in this repository.

## Security Policy Packs
- **security_policy_pack.ts**: Enforces mandatory controls for public access, encryption, IAM least privilege, and network security.
- **compliance_policy.ts**: Enforces required resource tags for compliance.
- **tagging_policy.py**: Enforces required tags on all resources.

## CI/CD Security Scanning
- See `SECURITY_CICD.md` for integrating Checkov, tfsec, and Snyk into your pipeline.

## Incident Response & Recovery
- See `INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md` for playbooks and backup/recovery procedures.

## Audit Logging
- Enable versioning and object lock on all audit buckets.
- Ensure all critical actions are logged and retained for compliance.

## Secrets Management
- Use Pulumi ESC, KMS, or cloud-native secret managers for all credentials.
- Scan for hardcoded secrets and migrate to secure management.

## IAM Controls
- Enforce MFA, session limits, permissions boundaries, and least privilege.
- Review and restrict IAM policies regularly.

## Compliance Mapping
- Map resources to PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOC2, ISO27001, and CIS frameworks.
- Automate compliance validation using policy packs.

## Backup & Disaster Recovery
- Schedule automated backups and enable cross-region replication.
- Test restoration and failover procedures regularly.
