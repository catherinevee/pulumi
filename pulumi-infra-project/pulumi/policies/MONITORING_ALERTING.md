# Monitoring & Alerting Best Practices

## Logging
- Enable logging for all critical resources (e.g., S3, RDS, VPC, ECS).
- Use centralized log storage with versioning and object lock.
- Integrate with SIEM solutions for real-time analysis.

## Monitoring
- Use AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, or GCP Operations Suite for metrics and health checks.
- Set up dashboards for key performance and security metrics.

## Alerting
- Configure alerts for suspicious activity, failed backups, and compliance violations.
- Integrate with incident response workflows.
