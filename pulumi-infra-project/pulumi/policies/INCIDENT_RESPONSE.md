# Incident Response & Disaster Recovery

## Incident Response Playbook
1. **Detection**: Monitor logs and alerts for suspicious activity.
2. **Analysis**: Investigate alerts using SIEM and audit logs.
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected resources (network, IAM, etc.).
4. **Eradication**: Remove threats and vulnerabilities.
5. **Recovery**: Restore from backups, validate integrity.
6. **Post-Incident Review**: Document incident, update playbooks, and train teams.

## Backup & Recovery Procedures
- **Automated Backups**: Schedule regular backups for all critical resources (databases, storage, configs).
- **Immutable Storage**: Use versioning and object lock for audit logs and backups.
- **Replication**: Enable cross-region replication for disaster recovery.
- **Testing**: Regularly test backup restoration and failover procedures.
