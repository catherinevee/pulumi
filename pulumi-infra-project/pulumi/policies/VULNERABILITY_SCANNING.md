# Vulnerability Scanning Integration

## Recommended Tools
- **Checkov**: Static analysis for infrastructure as code
- **tfsec**: Security scanner for Terraform
- **Snyk**: Dependency and code vulnerability scanner

## Example GitHub Actions Workflow
See `SECURITY_CICD.md` for a full workflow example.

## Best Practices
- Run scans on every pull request and before deployment.
- Fail builds on critical vulnerabilities.
- Review and remediate findings before merging.
